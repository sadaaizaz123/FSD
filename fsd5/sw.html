          Swami Vivekananda (/ˈswɑːmi ˌvɪveɪˈkɑːnəndə/)[a] (12 January 1863 – 4
          July 1902), born Narendranath Datta[b], was an Indian Hindu monk,
          philosopher, author, religious teacher, and the chief disciple of the
          Indian mystic Ramakrishna.[4][5] Vivekananda was a major figure in the
          introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world,[6][7][8] and is
          credited with raising interfaith awareness and elevating Hinduism to
          the status of a major world religion.[9]

          Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family in Calcutta (now
          Kolkata), Vivekananda showed an early inclination towards religion and
          spirituality. At the age of 18, he met Ramakrishna and became his
          devoted disciple, and later took up the vows of a sannyasin
          (renunciate). Following Ramakrishna’s death, Vivekananda travelled
          extensively across the Indian subcontinent as a wandering monk,
          gaining first-hand knowledge of the often harsh living conditions
          endured by the Indian masses under then British India, he sought a way
          to alleviate their suffering by establishing social services but
          lacked capital. In 1893, he travelled to the United States to
          participate in the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago,
          where he delivered a landmark speech beginning with the words "Sisters
          and brothers of America...". His powerful message introduced Hindu
          spiritual thought and advocated for both religious tolerance and
          universal acceptance.[10][11] The speech made a profound impression;
          an American newspaper described him as "an orator by divine right and
          undoubtedly the greatest figure at the Parliament".[12]
